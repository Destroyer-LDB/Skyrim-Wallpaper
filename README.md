## General Introduction
My own collection of photographs of scenery in Skyrim which can serve as wallpapers.

Recently I've been taking Screenshots in Skyrim (actually Skyrim Special Edition) to collect photos for my collection of Skyrim Wallpapers, and these days I've got a lot of photos and I set up a Github Repository for this collection. It now has 45 photos together with a short [readme.md](https://github.com/Dinok-in/Skyrim-Wallpaper/blob/main/README.md).

This is free and ready to use for everybody. If you want to make your desktop beautiful, just go to https://github.com/Dinok-in/Skyrim-Wallpaper and download the photo collection. 

**The photos come in .png format and are 1920*1080.**

**If you have questions, please write them at [issue #1](https://github.com/Dinok-in/Skyrim-Wallpaper/issues/1). Please don't make a new issue, unless you are experiencing bugs or you want to contribute.**

My PC is kind of old--it's 6 year old, and it only has a integated GPU, so the quality isn't very good if you zoom in and see some aliasing. However, as desktop background photos don't need to be resized, the photos will **still look good**, especially when you have a much smaller screen.

Here's my computer information:
```

  Type: SSD

GPU: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600

If you have a better PC and want to contribute to this repository, please see the Contributing section below.

## Contributing
You can set up pull requests or report issues on [the Github Repository](https://github.com/Dinok-in/Skyrim-Wallpaper).
To create a new issue, go to https://github.com/Dinok-in/Skyrim-Wallpaper/issues. To create a new pull request, go to https://github.com/Dinok-in/Skyrim-Wallpaper/pulls.
Before you create a PR, make sure you are taking screenshots as follows:
1. Find someplace or something you want to take a photo for, and press "~" to bring up the in-game console. Type "tm" and press Enter, then press PrtScn (or PrintScreen) to take the photo. The command "tm" is used to disable UI and menus when you take photos.
2. Rename the screenshot as the following format:
```
Place - Object.png
```
  For example, [Helgen - Alduin attacking the town.png](.\Helgen%20-%20Alduin%20attacking%20the%20town.png) is OK.
